As you can notice its inspired 90% on d3b0o's dotfiles, I dont want to take property of what's not mine. 
Just uploaded this dotfiles for some people of Hack4U community, this are my actual and unique dotfiles 
and they are just like d3b0o's one but with own personal modifications.

Thanks d3b0o for the original idea.
